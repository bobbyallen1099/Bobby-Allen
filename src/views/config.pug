Growing and building my curiosity not just on how they work but by how the very sites I love and use run. I always strived for a challenge of knowing and the answer to why? until I decided to work towards a career in web design to understand my question deeper. I always aim to improve and adapt to new trends and learn and that is a commitment I still hold high to today. <br><br> In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family. Keeping up with the newest technology. I'm also known as a bit of a nerd in the family always helping and fixing various tech issues they may have."
